This is a project created to share my experience (as well as any lack of experience thereof) on web development with the developers comunity.

I'll have reached my goal if we use this project as a starting point for leaning, discussing and discovery.

I don't intend to create here the perfect product, byt the best possible product we can build togather. 

## What we're doing

We are developing together a Ruby on Rails complete application, starting from the basics and moving all the way into production deploy.

## Functional requirements

The functional requirements for this application ar:
* Control timesheets (*controle de horas*) of an employee/business partner, allowing him/her to add details and comments as well as eventually attaching documents (i.e. proof of doctors appointment in case of a medical leave).

## Technical environment

For this application we'll need:
* To identify the user with name, address and allowing (optionally) him/her to add a picture.
* Control the application access through email/password authentication.
